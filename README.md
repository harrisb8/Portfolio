# Portfolio
 update site
 
 7/12/2022
 This is an update version of my Portfolio website. I kept the old version of my portfolio made with just html and Css seperate. This updated version not only has Html, CSS but also Bootstrap included.
 
 My Portfolio was one of the first projects that I started so I had some bad habits within my code such as not commenting, the spacing/structure to make the code look clean. Which made it a little challenging when I went back to update my code. I didn't fully understand my thought process with certain things. I was able to implement Bootstrap to my work with made the process of desinging easier as well as implement links and icon to my work. For my color scheme I wanted to have a very playful feel to my site while keeping it simple.
 
 As I continue to grow my skills I look to add animations and transitions to my site.
